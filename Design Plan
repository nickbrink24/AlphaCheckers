Design Presentation (DUE THURSDAY 3/29 at 8am):
 
-       UML Class Diagram – Katherine
-       Algorithm – Griselda
o   Check capture piece: code on github repos with explanations
§  Check diagonal method that checks the surroundings of the selected piece
§  If the piece is on the border of the board (row = 0,7 and col = 0,7) then the piece cannot be captured
·      Method called checkDiagonal that returns true if there is a piece diagonal to the selected piece
§  In the actual checkCapture method, it will check for open spaces that are two diagonal away given that checkDiagonal returns true
-       Test Plan Sample - Ethan 
o   Capture a piece
o   Move a piece
o   Promote a piece
-       Schedule - Griselda
o   Needs 6 major milestones and when they will be achieved – has to be things that we have not set achieved.
§  1- all 5/5 classes finished(alpha release)
§  2- add start-up screen
§  3- 
§  4- 3/3 tests working
§  5-
§  6- 
 
BY WEDNESDAY MORNING: FINISH CONTENT FOR SLIDES SO THAT IT CAN BE PROOFREAD, EDITED, AND REFORMATTED 


ROLES

MOTIONEVENT - ETHAN AND KATHERINE

DRAW BOARD/IMPORT PIECES - GRISELDA AND RUTH(???)

DEBUG/EDIT AND TEST MAKEMOVE AND CAPTURE - ETHAN AND NICK

Alpha Testing (DUE THURSDAY APRIL 6th at 8AM):
-       HIGHEST IMPORTANCE: GRAPHICS AND BOARD FOR VISUAL TESTING
o   Board is going to be drawn using basic java graphics
o   Pieces are going to be images that we can just get online and put in res folder
§  Only 4 images needed (red piece, black piece, kings of both)

-   SECOND IMPORTANCE: IMPLEMENTING MOTIONTOUCH
	- motionevent to get the coordinates for where the user touches
		- Theoretically, let's say squares are length 100
- the row and col coordinate / 100 will give you the index of the 2d array
	- ONDRAW: DRAW BOARD WITH SET SIZE OF SQUARES TO HELP IMPLEMENT ABOVE
	- Every time an action is made, invalidate() to update the board based off the positions in the 2d array (may have to use loop to get entire info of array)

Basic debug/edits to makeMove and capture methods

-       Bare Minimum: Just launch straight into the game and be able to play the game (Have the buttons, but they do not need to be perfectly implemented)
